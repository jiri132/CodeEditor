## Why should you use Flare instead of other editors?

Where other editors rely on Electron, a framework with its roots in yesteryears, Flare breaks free from these shackles, harnessing the power of modern technologies to achieve unparalleled speed and responsiveness. The result is an editor that launches instantaneously, making every second count in your coding endeavors.

Crafted with minimalism in mind, Flare champions simplicity without compromising functionality. Its sleek interface is tailored to maximize screen real estate, putting your code front and center. Unburdened by unnecessary features, Flare embraces a focused approach that caters exclusively to your coding essentials.

Embracing the latest advancements in software development, Flare thrives on cutting-edge technologies while leaving the sluggishness of outdated frameworks behind. Say farewell to waiting for your editor to catch up, and embrace the future of coding with Flare â€“ where lightweight meets limitless possibilities.

## Features

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: The server-side of the application is built using Rust, a systems programming language known for its performance and safety features.

- **Frontend**: The user interface is built with Svelte, a modern JavaScript framework that compiles components to highly efficient vanilla JavaScript.

- **TypeScript**: TypeScript is used to add static typing to JavaScript, providing enhanced development tools and reducing errors.

## Design

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [**Rust**](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed.
- [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/) and **npm** (Node Package Manager) installed.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jiri132/Flare.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the backend directory: `cd src-tauri/src/` and run `cargo run` to start the Rust backend server.
3. Open another terminal window, navigate to the frontend directory: `cd src` and run the following commands:
   - `npm install` to install the required frontend dependencies.
   - `npm run dev` to start the Svelte development server.

The app should now be running and accessible at `http://localhost:5000`.
